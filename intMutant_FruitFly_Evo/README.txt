inf_gt.Rdata - R object of the same name with information about the genotypes. 25-by-6 data frame. Row names are genotype ID. Column names are: WT, wild type; allele, indicating the mutant allele; gene; gene abbr; pathway; N, sample size

inf_spec.Rdata - R object of the same name with information about the specimens. 1880-by-4 data frame. rownames are specimen ID. Column names are: WT, wild type; genotype, genotype ID as in inf_gt; repID, replicate ID; centsize, centroid size

XallData.Rdata - R object named Xall with landmark coordinates after Procrustes superimposition. 1880-by-96 numeric matrix. Columns ordered as “x1, y1, x2, y2…”

JxcTPS.dat - a tab limited table with LORY data, using TPS as interpolation function. Data was not regressed on size

JxcEBS.dat - a tab limited table with LORY data, using EBSS as interpolation function. Data was not regressed on size

JxcTPSsr.dat - a tab limited table with LORY data, using TPS as interpolation function. Data was regressed on size before running in LORY
